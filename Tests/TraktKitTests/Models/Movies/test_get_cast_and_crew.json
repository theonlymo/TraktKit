                "biography": "Robert John Downey, Jr. (born April 4, 1965) is an American actor. His films as a leading actor have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Downey's career has been characterized by some early success, a period of drug-related problems and run-ins with the law, and a surge in popular and commercial success in the 2000s. In 2008, Downey was named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. From 2013 to 2015, he was listed by Forbes as Hollywood's highest-paid actor.\n\nAt the age of five, Downey made his acting debut in his father Robert Downey Sr.'s film Pound in 1970. He subsequently worked with the Brat Pack in the teen films Weird Science (1985) and Less than Zero (1987). Downey's portrayal of Charlie Chaplin in the 1992 biopic Chaplin received a BAFTA Award. Following a stint at the Corcoran Substance Abuse Treatment Facility on drug charges, he joined the TV series Ally McBeal in 2000, and won a Golden Globe Award for the role. Downey was fired from the show in 2001 in the wake of additional drug charges. He stayed in a court-ordered drug treatment program and has maintained his sobriety since 2003.\n\nDowney made his acting comeback in the 2003 film The Singing Detective, after Mel Gibson paid his insurance bond because completion bond companies would not insure himю He went on to star in the black comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005), the thriller Zodiac (2007), and the action comedy Tropic Thunder (2008). Downey gained global recognition for starring as Iron Man in ten films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008), and leading up to Avengers: Endgame (2019). He has also played Sherlock Holmes in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes (2009), which earned him his second Golden Globe, and its sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows (2011). Downey has also taken on dramatic parts in The Judge (2014) and Oppenheimer (2023), winning an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, and a BAFTA Award for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in the latter.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Robert Downey Jr., licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

                "biography": "Egyptian-born film-maker and actor Sayed Badreya realized a childhood dream by winning roles in major Hollywood films such as The Insider, Three Kings, and Independence Day.  Growing up in poverty in Port Said, Sayed Badreya's dreams of movie stardom looked as bleak as the prospect of peace in the Middle East. From the Six Day War in '67 through the Yom Kippur War in '73, his only escape from the world he knew was the movie theater, where films transported him to a magical land. But it was here that he determined he was destined to be a part of that magic.  After attending New York University film school, and then moving to Hollywood, Sayed first worked in the film industry as an assistant to actor/director Anthony Perkins, and then with director James Cameron on True Lies.  His mission - to make movies that told the Arabic- American story, since it had yet to be told - led to the creation of his own production company, Zoom In Focus. Under this banner, he directed and produced the documentary, Saving Egyptian Film Classics as well as The Interrogation, which won Best Creative Short Film at New York International Film Festival. He also produced and starred in Hesham Issawi's short, T for Terrorist, which was awarded Best Short Film at the Boston International Film Festival and the San Francisco World Film Festival. In 2007, he played his first leading role in the English language motion picture American East, a film that he also co-wrote.  2008 was Sayed Badreya's breakout year. He captivated audiences as Abu Bakaar, the villainous arms dealer who kidnaps Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the summer's blockbuster Iron Man. Also that year, Sayed played the comedic Palestinian cab driver opposite Adam Sandler in You Don't Mess with the Zohan.  This summer, Sayed can be seen in Paramount Pictures' feature film El traspatio aka Backyard, directed by Oscar-nominated Carlos Carrera in which he plays a serial killer opposite Ana de la Reguera. Sayed can also be seen this summer in Movie 43, where he plays opposite Halle Berry. Additional forthcoming films include The Three Stooges, his fifth film with the Farrelly brothers; The Dictator, playing Sascha Baron Cohen's father as the original Dictator, and Just Like a Woman, with Oscar nominated director Rachid Bouchareb. Also, Sayed is going to a new frontier in the new video game Uncharted 3, playing Ramses the Great Pirate Captain.  Most recently he completed his second leading role in the New York independent feature, Cargo, about human traffickers, directed by Yan Vizinberg. And he just finished co-starring opposite Oscar-nominated actress Melissa Leo in film The Space Between, directed by Travis Fine.  Sayed has also worked as an actor, Arabic dialect coach, and Islamic technical advisor on Path to 9/11, a $40 million mini-series about the events leading up to 9/11 produced by ABC/Touchstone.  Sayed's efforts to bring attention to Arab-Americans in the motion picture industry have received much coverage over the years on radio, television, and in major publications around the world, such as The New York Times, GQ, NPR, ABC's \"Politically Incorrect\" with Bill Maher, BBC's \"Panorama,\" CNN, \"Fox Report with Shepard Smith\", The Hollywood Reporter and Egypt Today.",

                "biography": "Nazanin Boniadi was born in Tehran, Iran, at the height of the Iranian Revolution; her parents relocated to London shortly thereafter. She performed violin and ballet as a young girl.\n\nShe attended a private high school and later moved to the United States where she earned a bachelor's degree, with honors, in biological sciences from the University of California, Irvine. At UCI, she won the Chang Pin-Chun Undergraduate Research Award for molecular research involving cancer treatment and heart transplant rejection. She was also Assistant Editor-in-Chief of MedTimes, UCI's undergraduate medical newspaper.\n\nNazanin Boniadi is rapidly making her mark in both film and television. She co-starred as CIA analyst Fara Sherazi on seasons three and four of the Emmy and Golden Globe award-winning drama Homeland (2011), for which she shared a 2015 SAG Award nomination in the Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series category. Boniadi appeared in the 2016 MGM-Paramount remake of Ben-Hur. Directed by Timur Bekmambetov, the film stars Ms. Boniadi in the female lead role of Esther opposite Jack Huston, Morgan Freeman and Toby Kebbell. She will next appear in a leading role opposite Armie Hammer and Dev Patel in Anthony Maras's Hotel Mumbai.\n\nAmong her many television credits, Boniadi portrayed Nora, a relatively longstanding love interest to Neil Patrick Harris's Barney Stinson, in seasons six and seven of How I Met Your Mother (2005). She also appeared as the notorious Adnan Salif in season three of Shonda Rhimes' hit political drama Scandal (2012). She will next star alongside J.K. Simmons in the original Starz series Counterpart (2017), created by Justin Marks and Executive Produced by Morten Tyldum.\n\nOn film, Boniadi appeared as Amira Ahmed in Jon Favreau's Iron Man (2008) and portrayed a young mother, Elaine, in Paul Haggis' The Next Three Days (2010). She also has several independent features to her credit.\n\nBorn in Tehran at the height of the Iranian Revolution, Boniadi's parents relocated to London, England, shortly thereafter, where she was raised with an emphasis on education. While she was involved in theatre early in life, Boniadi later decided she wanted to become a physician. She moved to the United States at the age of 19 to attend the University of California, Irvine, where she received her Bachelor's Degree, with Honors (Dean's Academic Achievement and Service Award) in Biological Sciences, and won the \"Chang Pin Chun\" Undergraduate Research Award for her work in heart-transplant rejection and cancer research.\n\nSwitching gears to pursue her first love, Boniadi then decided to study acting, which included training in Contemporary Drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London under the supervision of dramaturge Lloyd Trott.\n\nBoniadi is fluent in both English and Persian. She is a dedicated human rights activist. Boniadi served as a spokesperson for Amnesty International USA (AIUSA) 2009-2015, and continues to partner with the non-profit as an AIUSA Artist of Conscience.",

                "biography": "Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922–November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. He was Marvel's primary creative leader for two decades, expanding it from a small publishing house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.\n\nFollowing his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. He continued independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stan Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He always brought his cameras with him to build his photography portfolio. His photography has been published in Vogue, Cosmopolitan and Bride magazines.\n\nHe continued modeling and acting while pursuing his education after being awarded a full athletic scholarship.

Ever since watching Evel Knievel live at the old Chicago amphitheater jump 10 buses at age 8 and seeing Hooper (1978) in the theaters as an impressionable 13-year-old boy, he knew he wanted to become a Hollywood Stuntman.\n\nAfter many odd jobs, sales was his niche, but stunts always loomed in the background. He was a successful food broker, selling steak and seafood door to door throughout the Chicagoland area. When a stunt school opened in Chicago in 1988, Joe jumped at the opportunity. From there, he honed his stunt skills and learned about the motion picture industry, hustling sets and working as an extra. After several years he hustled the sets and got his big break doubling for Steven Seagal and hasn't looked back. Since then, Joe has also doubled for Arnold Schwarzenegger, Will Ferrell, John Cusack, Jeff Goldblum, David Hasselhoff, Dan Marino, and Vince Vaughn. He has been nominated twice for the World Stunt Awards and has won two Emmy awards for best action sequences for television.",

After twenty five plus years in the industry and over one hundred fifty film and tv credits, Mr Bray made his television directorial debut in 2015 with Katie Heigl's tv series \"State of Affairs\" for NBC/Universal, he then went on to direct episodes for Fox/Bruckheimer, CW/Greg Berlanti and ABC/Freeform. In 2018 will be Bray's feature film debut which he co-wrote with Joe Carnahan called \"El Chicano\" a Mexican Super hero story about two brothers growing up in East L.A. The story was inspired and originally written by Bray 10 years earlier after losing his youngest brother to gang violence. The film is being produced by War Party Productions and Lorenzo di Bonaventura.",

He started with a passion for animation at age six, when he began drawing flip pages of his favourite cartoons. He focused on this craft until he was introduced to martial arts at an early age. Martial arts would ultimately turn into a lifelong obsession for Robert. He trained incessantly and eventually earned black belts in Tae Kwon Do and Hapkido, training under Grandmaster Jun Chong.\n\nRobert’s devotion to martial arts was fueled by his hunger for knowledge of all martial arts styles and disciplines. This passion led him to broaden his training, become proficient in multiple martial arts disciplines, and compete and excel in various international martial arts competitions.\n\nAlthough Robert had a deep passion for martial arts, he never forgot his childhood dreams of filmmaking. After graduating from Loyola High School in Los Angeles, he received an academic scholarship to attend Loyola Marymount University (LMU), where he earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Studio Arts and Communication Studies while minoring in Animation and Business Marketing. This is where Robert trained under Dan McLaughlin and made his first hand-drawn animated senior thesis film titled “The Dive of Life.\" After graduating from LMU, Robert dabbled in the commercial world as a junior art director at Envision Group, but ultimately his love for martial arts and film came calling and led him to become a stunt performer.",

                    "biography": "Avi Arad (/ˈɑːvi ˈɑːrɑːd/; Hebrew: אבי ארד; born August 1, 1948) is an Israeli-American studio executive and producer of film, television, and animation. He became the CEO of Toy Biz in the 1990s, was the chief creative officer of Marvel Entertainment, and is the founder, former chairman, and former CEO of the latter's successor, Marvel Studios. Since then, he has produced and sometimes written a wide array of live-action, animated, and television comic book adaptations, including Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\nArad was born in 1948 in Ramat Gan, Israel, to a Jewish family. The son of Holocaust survivors from Poland, he grew up reading Superman and Spider-Man comics translated into Hebrew. In 1965, he was conscripted as a soldier into the Israel Defence Forces (IDF). He fought and was wounded in the 1967 Six-Day War and spent 15 days recuperating. Arad finished his military service in 1968.\n\nIn 1970, Arad moved to the United States and enrolled at Hofstra University to study industrial management. He worked as a truck driver and as a Hebrew teacher to put himself through college and graduated with a BBA in 1972.\n\nAlong with Israeli-American Toy Biz co-owner Isaac Perlmutter, Avi Arad came into conflict with Carl Icahn and Ron Perelman over control of Marvel Comics in the wake of its 1996 bankruptcy. In the end, Arad and Perlmutter came out on top, with Toy Biz taking over Marvel Comics in a complicated deal that included obtaining the rights to Spider-Man and other superheroes that Marvel had sold earlier. He was involved in Marvel's emergence from bankruptcy and the expansion of the company's profile through licensing and movies.\n\nOn May 31, 2006, Arad resigned from his various Marvel positions, including his leadership of Marvel Studios, to form his own production company, Arad Productions (also known as Arad Animation), a company that primarily produces Marvel-licensed films separate from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. His first non-Marvel film was 2007's Bratz. Further ventures include the manga adaptation Ghost in the Shell; an adaptation of Brandon Mull's teenage fantasy Fablehaven (which died in production); an adaptation of James Patterson's teenage novel Maximum Ride; and adaptations of video game properties Uncharted, Infamous, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda.\n\nIn August 2010, it was announced that Arad was given a chair with the American branch of animation studio Production I.G in Los Angeles, California.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Avi Arad, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

She relocated again to Los Angeles, where she began working in the visual effects industry, including at Digital Domain as a visual effects producer for four years, working on films such as Big Fish (2003), which was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects at the 57th British Academy Film Awards.\n\nAlonso joined Marvel Studios in 2005 as executive vice president of visual effects and post-production, working as a co-producer on Marvel Cinematic Universe films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2010), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and serving as executive producer on every Marvel Studios production since The Avengers (2012), including television shows. She was promoted to executive vice president of production in 2015. In 2021, Alonso was promoted to president of physical and post-production, visual effects, and animation at Marvel Studios.\n\nIn 2016, Alonso became the first woman to win the Advanced Imaging Society's Harold Lloyd Award for her achievements in visual effects. In January 2020, she was awarded the Filmmaker Award by the Motion Picture Sound Editors at the 67th Golden Reel Awards. In October 2021, it was announced that Alonso would be the top honouree at Outfest's Visionary Award at the November ceremony at LA's Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.\n\nIn December 2022, she was named on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Women in Entertainment Power 100.\".\n\nIn 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios for breach of contract after violating her noncompete clause by serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985, despite having failed to seek permission to work on the film and continuing to promote it after being ordered by Disney to cease her involvement with the project.\n\nAt the time of her firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted, who had raised complaints of Marvel's \"demanding post-production schedules.\" Alonso was described by some as a \"kingmaker,\" with Chris Lee at Vulture reporting that Alonso was \"singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment.\" However, Alonso was also described as the \"epitome of professional\" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson of The Ringer describing the reports as a \"gross mischaracterization\" and the opposite of Alonso's work. Alonso said that the real reason for her firing was her outspoken opposition to LGBTQ+ erasure at the company. Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.\n\nAlonso is openly gay and is married to Australian actress Imelda Corcoran. The couple has one adopted daughter.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Victoria Alonso, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. He was Marvel's primary creative leader for two decades, expanding it from a small publishing house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.\n\nFollowing his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. He continued independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stan Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

                    "biography": "Matthew Libatique (born July 19, 1968) is an American cinematographer. He is best known for his collaborations with director Darren Aronofsky on the films Pi (1998), Requiem for a Dream (2000), The Fountain (2006), Black Swan (2010), Noah (2014), and Mother! (2017). Libatique has received three Academy Award for Best Cinematography nominations for his work on Black Swan (2010), A Star Is Born (2018), and Maestro (2023).\n\nMatthew Libatique was born in Elmhurst, Queens, New York City, to Filipino immigrant parents Georgina (née José) and Justiniáno Libatique. His father was from Dagupan, and his mother was from Lucena.\n\nLibatique studied sociology and communications at California State University, Fullerton, before earning an MFA in cinematography at AFI Conservatory.\n\nLibatique served as director of photography for music videos and teamed with fellow AFI alumnus Aronofsky for the short film Protozoa. The two collaborated on the first three of Aronofsky's feature films. Other frequent collaborators are Julie Dash (music videos including Tracy Chapman's \"Give Me One Reason\"), Spike Lee (She Hate Me, Inside Man, and Miracle at St. Anna), Joel Schumacher (Tigerland, Phone Booth, and The Number 23), and Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Cowboys \u0026 Aliens).\n\nLibatique's notable films include blockbusters such as Iron Man and Iron Man 2. In 2010, he was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Cinematography for his work on Black Swan, for which he won his second Independent Spirit Award. He has also won best cinematography awards at the LA Film Critics Association, NY Film Critics Online, SF Film Critics, among many others.\n\nLibatique discussed the importance of working closely with a director on a Cinematographer Roundtable with The Hollywood Reporter, revealing: “The main thing is that you (both the cinematographer and director) have the same goal and are telling the same story. Going into preparation, you really need to be on the same page. Conflicts may arise when there’s a miscommunication about what’s important in a scene. So, it’s really important to listen...The director can (understandably) get pulled in a lot of different directions in prep. We, cinematographers, are sort of guarding the gate of filmmaking, amongst all the other things that are happening.”\n\nIn addition to guarding the filmmaking gate, he also says of his process, “I’d like to think each film is custom made. The director obviously dictates the approach that I have because everybody has a different working style. Some people want to talk intensely and visually about shots. Some don’t talk much at all. They concentrate more on the performances, and they give you a broad idea of what they want the film to look like. So my first approach is to evaluate them, which may start in the interview process. But you also learn in preparation, as much as you can, about the director. And that informs how I prepare in pre-production. If I’m lucky, I can shape a visual language off some kind of inspiration. But the director definitely dictates how I do it.”\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Matthew Libatique, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

                    "biography": "Luis Gabriel Beristáin, ASC, BSC, AMC, is a Mexican cinematographer, producer, and television director known for his work on numerous well-known films, including The Distinguished Gentleman, The Spanish Prisoner, Blade II, and Street Kings, and several entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the Agent Carter television series.\n\nHe has collaborated with filmmakers like Guillermo del Toro, Derek Jarman, David Mamet, and David Ayer. He is an active member of both the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\n\nBeristain was born in Mexico City, the son of actor Luis Beristáin. His interest in filmmaking began with his involvement in Mexico's independent film scene in the seventies. He studied engineering at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional and later joined a new film studies program at the school while also producing audiovisual training materials for the health department.\n\nAfter filming a number of documentaries, he founded a small commercial production company before moving to Italy in 1977. At the recommendation of director Sergio Leone, he relocated to the United Kingdom, where he enrolled in the prestigious National Film and Television School, which accepted only 25 students a year. He was one of only five foreigners to be accepted into the school and studied cinematography under Oswald Morris and Billy Williams.\n\nHis first feature film as a cinematographer was the 1983 Colombian horror film Bloody Flesh (Spanish: Carne de tu carne, \"Flesh of Your Flesh\"), for which he won the Best Cinematography Award at the Bogotá Film Festival. His work on Derek Jarman's 1986 film Caravaggio earned him a Special Silver Bear Award at the Berlin International Film Festival. Beristain was one of several cinematographers on the 1987 anthology film Aria, which was nominated for a Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Allen Daviau suggested he move to Hollywood, where he could apply his talents and unique insight into both Mexican and Anglo cultures. Beristain has been a member of the British Society of Cinematographers since 1990 and the American Society of Cinematographers since 2002.\n\nWhile working on 2003's S.W.A.T., Beristain became friends with executive producer Louis D'Esposito, who, after helping form Marvel Studios, invited Beristain to do additional photography for Iron Man. He wound up in the same function in six other Marvel Cinematic Universe films and also served as cinematographer for the D'Esposito-directed Marvel One-Shot short films Item 47 (2012) and Agent Carter (2013), as well as the television series Agent Carter. Beristein would eventually have his first feature for the studio as cinematographer in 2021's Black Widow.\n\nBeristain had a son born in 1980 who lived in Austria and died in 2000.\n\nBeristain's influences are Gregg Toland, Freddie Young, Emmanuel Lubezki, and Roger Deakins.

He is known for his work on films Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Iron Man, Oscar-winner The Artist, Love Affair, TV shows Gilmore Girls, Monk and many more. When not leading his Klezmer-fusion band The OY!Stars, he has performed with the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Hollywood Bowl Orchestra and been seen by millions as the Orchestra Conductor in United Airlines commercials and other TV shows and films. Born in Brooklyn, NY, Richard began playing music professionally in rural Georgia by age 13 including backing up Jerry Lee Lewis and other Sun Records Rockabilly pioneers. At age 20 after earning a BFA in Theatre from University of Georgia, he moved to Atlanta where he wrote and performed songs for theatre and bands, including a \"black consciousness raising theater\" of which he was a founding member along with Samuel L. Jackson (Richard generally acting the villainous white roles). Performing in shows by Sid \u0026 Marty Krofft led to relocating to Los Angeles where he was a regular on NBC's Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters for two seasons while simultaneously leading his trio in downtown L.A.'s Bonaventure Hotel. Session work for films and major artists followed, as did performing in concert with Blue Man Group, Marvin Hamlisch, Theodore Bikel and many others. Along the way, Richard has written hundreds of songs, authored TV animation scripts for Hanna Barbara and Filmation, brought the creations of Jim Henson to life in major films, and played Mandolin, Tenor Banjo and Classical Guitar for Geffen Playhouse's production of Schlemiel the First. He acted the role of mysterious G-Man in Half-Life: Raise the Bar and many Mafia characters. His several international, Rock, and Folk music bands are regularly seen performing around Los Angeles and Las Vegas. Richard gives seminars in Ethnomusicology for students at California State University and University of Southern California, and is active in performing for Holocaust survivor groups.",

                    "biography": "Stan Lee (born Stanley Martin Lieber /ˈliːbər/; December 28, 1922–November 12, 2018) was an American comic book writer, editor, publisher, and producer. He rose through the ranks of a family-run business called Timely Comics, which later became Marvel Comics. He was Marvel's primary creative leader for two decades, expanding it from a small publishing house division to a multimedia corporation that dominated the comics and film industries.\n\nIn collaboration with others at Marvel—particularly co-writers and artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko—he co-created iconic characters, including Spider-Man, the X-Men, Iron Man, Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, the Wasp, the Fantastic Four, Black Panther, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, the Scarlet Witch, and Black Widow. These and other characters' introductions in the 1960s pioneered a more naturalistic approach in superhero comics. In the 1970s, Lee challenged the restrictions of the Comics Code Authority, indirectly leading to changes in its policies. In the 1980s, he pursued the development of Marvel properties in other media, with mixed results.\n\nFollowing his retirement from Marvel in the 1990s, Lee remained a public figurehead for the company. He frequently made cameo appearances in films and television shows based on Marvel properties, on which he received an executive producer credit, which allowed him to become the person with the highest-grossing film total ever. He continued independent creative ventures until his death, aged 95, in 2018. Lee was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 1994 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1995. He received the NEA's National Medal of Arts in 2008.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Stan Lee, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

                    "biography": "Jack Kirby (born Jacob Kurtzberg; August 28, 1917–February 6, 1994) was an American comic book artist, widely regarded as one of the medium's major innovators and one of its most prolific and influential creators. He grew up in New York City and learnt to draw cartoon figures by tracing characters from comic strips and editorial cartoons. He entered the nascent comics industry in the 1930s, drawing various comics features under different pen names, including Jack Curtiss, before settling on Jack Kirby. In 1940, he and writer-editor Joe Simon created the highly successful superhero character Captain America for Timely Comics, predecessor of Marvel Comics. During the 1940s, Kirby regularly teamed with Simon, creating numerous characters for that company and for National Comics Publications, later to become DC Comics.\n\nAfter serving in the European Theatre in World War II, Kirby produced work for DC Comics, Harvey Comics, Hillman Periodicals, and other publishers. At Crestwood Publications, he and Simon created the genre of romance comics and later founded their own short-lived comic company, Mainline Publications. Kirby was involved in Timely's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics, which in the next decade became Marvel. There, in the 1960s, Kirby cocreated many of the company's major characters, including Ant-Man, the Avengers, the Black Panther, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Iron Man, the Silver Surfer, Thor, and the X-Men, among many others. Kirby's titles garnered high sales and critical acclaim, but in 1970, feeling he had been treated unfairly, largely in the realm of authorship credit and creators' rights, Kirby left the company for rival DC.\n\nAt DC, Kirby created his Fourth World saga, which spanned several comic titles. While these series proved commercially unsuccessful and were cancelled, the Fourth World's New Gods have continued as a significant part of the DC Universe. Kirby returned to Marvel briefly in the mid-to-late 1970s and then ventured into television animation and independent comics. In his later years, Kirby, who has been called \"the William Blake of comics,\" began receiving great recognition in the mainstream press for his career accomplishments, and in 1987 he was one of the three inaugural inductees of the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. In 2017, Kirby was posthumously named a Disney Legend for his creations not only in the field of publishing but also because those creations formed the basis for The Walt Disney Company's financially and critically successful media franchise, the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\n\nKirby was married to Rosalind Goldstein in 1942. They had four children and remained married until his death from heart failure in 1994, at the age of 76. The Jack Kirby Awards and Jack Kirby Hall of Fame were named in his honour, and he is known as \"The King\" among comics fans for his many influential contributions to the medium.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Jack Kirby, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

She relocated again to Los Angeles, where she began working in the visual effects industry, including at Digital Domain as a visual effects producer for four years, working on films such as Big Fish (2003), which was nominated for Best Special Visual Effects at the 57th British Academy Film Awards.\n\nAlonso joined Marvel Studios in 2005 as executive vice president of visual effects and post-production, working as a co-producer on Marvel Cinematic Universe films Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), Thor (2010), and Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), and serving as executive producer on every Marvel Studios production since The Avengers (2012), including television shows. She was promoted to executive vice president of production in 2015. In 2021, Alonso was promoted to president of physical and post-production, visual effects, and animation at Marvel Studios.\n\nIn 2016, Alonso became the first woman to win the Advanced Imaging Society's Harold Lloyd Award for her achievements in visual effects. In January 2020, she was awarded the Filmmaker Award by the Motion Picture Sound Editors at the 67th Golden Reel Awards. In October 2021, it was announced that Alonso would be the top honouree at Outfest's Visionary Award at the November ceremony at LA's Academy Museum of Motion Pictures.\n\nIn December 2022, she was named on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Women in Entertainment Power 100.\".\n\nIn 2023, Alonso was fired from her role at Marvel Studios for breach of contract after violating her noncompete clause by serving as a producer on the Amazon Studios film Argentina, 1985, despite having failed to seek permission to work on the film and continuing to promote it after being ordered by Disney to cease her involvement with the project.\n\nAt the time of her firing, criticism from VFX workers was noted, who had raised complaints of Marvel's \"demanding post-production schedules.\" Alonso was described by some as a \"kingmaker,\" with Chris Lee at Vulture reporting that Alonso was \"singularly responsible for Marvel's toxic work environment.\" However, Alonso was also described as the \"epitome of professional\" and supportive on set, with Joanna Robinson of The Ringer describing the reports as a \"gross mischaracterization\" and the opposite of Alonso's work. Alonso said that the real reason for her firing was her outspoken opposition to LGBTQ+ erasure at the company. Disney and Alonso reached a multimillion-dollar compensation settlement in April.\n\nAlonso is openly gay and is married to Australian actress Imelda Corcoran. The couple has one adopted daughter.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Victoria Alonso, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

                    "biography": "Hal T. Hickel is a visual effects animator for Industrial Light \u0026 Magic.\n\nAt the age of 12, Hickel wrote a letter to Lucasfilm, outlining his ideas for a sequel to the original Star Wars movie (now known as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), and received a polite rejection letter from producer Gary Kurtz. The letter now hangs on the wall of Hickel's office at ILM. Twenty years later, Hickel found himself working on Star Wars after all, as a lead animator on Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace.\n\nA native of Bailey, Colorado, Hickel joined the Film Graphics Program at CalArts in 1982. He worked at An-FX from 1982 until 1988, and then joined Will Vinton Studios, working in stop-motion and motion control.\n\nHickel began his animation career at Pixar in 1994, where he worked on Toy Story and the THXpromos, as well as some of Pixar's short films. Hearing that a new Star Wars trilogy was in pre-production, Hickel applied for a transfer to ILM on the chance that he might get to work on the prequels. He was first assigned as an animator on The Lost World: Jurassic Park, but was eventually assigned to work on The Phantom Menace, and later its sequel, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, where he was responsible for the unique movement of the Droideka destroyer droids.\n\nHis other credits include A.I. Artificial Intelligence, Space Cowboys, Dreamcatcher and Van Helsing. In 2007, Hickel won the BAFTA and the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects along with John Knoll, Charles Gibson and Allen Hall, for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. He also received an Academy Award nomination for his work on Rogue One: A Star Wars Story.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Hal Hickel, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

His film credits include The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day; Aliens; Predator and Predator 2; The Lost World: Jurassic Park; Iron Man, Iron Man 2 and Iron Man 3; Pacific Rim and The Shape of Water.\n\nMahan was born and raised in Greenville, Michigan. After graduating from Greenville High School in 1981, he left for Hollywood. His first job was with Stan Winston Studios as a crew member working on The Terminator in 1983. There he worked as a creature effects supervisor. After Stan Winston's passing, he formed Legacy Effects with three partners who were also his former colleagues at Stan Winston Studios, and this has now become the leading VFX company in Hollywood.\n\nMahan and his design team made the special suits worn by Robert Downey Jr. in the film Iron Man. They also designed the suit for Iron Man, which was ten feet tall, weighed 800 lbs, and required five operators to puppeteer. Besides several other nominations, Mahan and his team were nominated for the 2008 Oscar for 'Best Achievement in Visual Effects' for Iron Man. The team was hired as concept artists by James Cameron for his film Avatar. This was special for Mahan, as his first special effects credits were for the film The Terminator.\n\nMahan worked for Stan Winston Studios until the death of Stan Winston in 2008, when he and three other veterans of the company, Lindsay MacGowan, J. Alan Scott, and John Rosengrant, incorporated Legacy Effects, a character design, make-up, and animatronic studio so named in honour of the late Winston's legacy and lifelong achievements. He lives in Los Angeles.",
