     Syncing with trakt opens up quite a few cool features. Most importantly, trakt can serve as a cloud based backup for the data in your app. This is especially useful when rebuilding a media center or installing a mobile app on your new phone. It can also be nice to sync up multiple media centers with a central trakt account. If everything is in sync, your media can be managed from trakt and be reflected in your apps.

     **Media objects for syncing**

     As a baseline, all add and remove sync methods accept arrays of `movies`, `shows`, and `episodes`. Each of these top level array elements should themselves be an array of standard `movie`, `show`, or `episode` objects. Full examples are in the intro section called **Standard Media Objects**. Keep in mind that `episode` objects really only need the `ids` so it can find an exact match. This is useful for absolute ordered shows. Some methods also have optional metadata you can attach, so check the docs for each specific method.

     Media objects will be matched by ID first, then fall back to title and year. IDs will be matched in this order `trakt`, `imdb`, `tmdb`, `tvdb`, and `slug`. If nothing is found, it will match on the `title` and `year`. If still nothing, it would use just the `title` (or `name` for people) and find the most current object that exists.

     ---
     **Watched History Sync**

     This is a 2 way sync that will get items from trakt to sync locally, plus find anything new and sync back to trakt. Perform this sync on startup or at set intervals (i.e. once every day) to keep everything in sync. This will only send data to trakt and not remove it.

     ---
     **Collection Sync**

     It's very handy to have a snapshot on trakt of everything you have available to watch locally. Syncing your local connection will do just that. This will only send data to trakt and not remove it.

     ---
     **Clean Collection**

     Cleaning a collection involves comparing the trakt collection to what exists locally. This will remove items from the trakt collection if they don't exist locally anymore. You should make this clear to the user that data might be removed from trakt.

         Add one of more items to a user's watchlist. Accepts shows, seasons, episodes and movies. If only a show is passed, only the show itself will be added. If seasons are specified, all of those seasons will be added.

         ---
         **Notes**

         Each watchlist item can optionally accept a `notes` (500 maximum characters) field with custom text. The user must be a Trakt VIP to send `notes`.

         ---
         **Limits**

         If the user's watchlist limit is exceeded, a `420` HTTP error code is returned. Use the ``TraktManager/CurrentUserResource/settings()`` method to get all limits for a user account. In most cases, upgrading to Trakt VIP will increase the limits.
